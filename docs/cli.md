## Command Line Interface

Nore should typically be used from the command line. You can provide an optional configuration file (`nore.js`) to simplify command line usage and enable advanced functionality.

For a detailed info on CLI options run `nore help`. Below are a few simple commands to get you started.

Start nore in development mode:

```sh
 $ nore start
```

Build source for production:

```sh
 $ nore build
```

Start nore and build a specific bundle (by handle) in testing mode:

```sh
 $ nore start client --mode testing
```
