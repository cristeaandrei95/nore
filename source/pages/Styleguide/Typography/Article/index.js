			<h1>Perfect typography is more science than an art</h1>
			<h2>Introduction to typography</h2>

			<p>
				“Perfect typography is more science than an art” is a famous quote
				attributed to Jan Tschichold—the man that published his revolutionary
				book The New Typography in 1927. He, among other typographers from that
				era, had a profound impact in the field of typography.{" "}
			</p>

			<p>
				“Typography is more art than engineering—though engineering is certainly
				a part of it” is what Robert Bringhurst, author of The Elements of
				Typographic Style (recognised as the typography bible), believes in.{" "}
			</p>

			<p>
				It might seem strange at first, that such influential men in typography
				could have such contradicting opinions when it comes to defining it.
				Tschichold believed it was more science, Bringhurst sees it more as an
				art. Both placed it on the line connecting the two but they placed it on
				the opposite ends.

				Tschichold was a part of the revolution in graphic design in the early
				1920s. It was the time of industrialization. A time when the engineer
				was seen as the savior of the world. Engineering was in front and center
				of whatever was produced. Type setting as a process was being swept into
				this new industrialized world. Whatever tools graphic designers used at
				that time, they needed engineering skills. This probably shaped
				Tschichold’s opinion when it came to defining typography.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bringhurst already witnessed the magic of digital design. There’s no
				more physical parts that need to be assembled in the type setting
				process. The age of information made that process a matter of seconds
				instead of hours. Designers only need the right software and a right
				printer these days. Both are tools they don’t produce themselves. So
				there’s very little, or no engineering in a modern print design process.
				Bringhurst focused on the print typography in his book which is what may
				sway his definition of typography more on the side of art.

			<h3>Web developers should have typography skills too</h3>

			<p>
				I believe that when it comes to the web, typography lies right in the
				middle. That’s why I think both designers and developers need to learn
				the basics of typography. It is expected from designers to have these
				skills. It’s expected that they know how to type set and when to choose
				what typeface. How to shape a paragraph and how to use a scale. How to
				use grids to establish rhythm in their work. I’ve worked with many
				designers so far and found that’s rarely the case. Either the designers
				are self-taught and haven’t learned about the importance of typography
				yet or they studied graphic design and saw it just as a class they had
				to attend. Developers, don’t expect your designers to be proficient in
				typography.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whatever gets designed for the web needs to be transformed into code.
				There is no printer. No magic button that transforms designs into code.
				Not in a way that could actually get used. People that can do both parts
				well, design and code, are rare. It takes a lot of time and dedication
				to really master both sets of skills. This means that even the designers
				who have good typography skills usually don’t have the skills to
				transform their work into what really counts—code. So it falls on web
				developers to cover a large part of this grey area. Web developers who
				aren’t expected to have any of those skills. Web developers that try
				their best to transform those designs into code, but fail to see small
				details that make a difference. It’s time we recognize the importance of
				their role in shaping web typography. It’s time we stop excluding them
				from the design process. The design process isn’t something designers
				should own themselves, it’s something where other people can take part
				and make their own contributions. Don’t simply follow what is drawn by a
				designer—an approximation of what the website should look like.
				Understand why it’s done so. Correct your designer when it doesn’t make
				sense. Work on web typography. Work on typographic details with your
				designer. Work together. It’s your job to produce a typographic style
				that works—as a team.
			</p>

			<p>
				That’s where Better Web Type comes in. And that’s why it’s designed for
				both web designers and web developers. Its goal is to put web typography
				right in the middle between art (design) and engineering (development).
				To cover most of that grey area and invite web developers in the design
				process. To educate the people that are involved (or the ones that
				should be) in a web design process to do a better job when it comes to
				web typography. To start producing a better web typography in order to
				be able to contribute to a better web. A web that is readable. A web
				that doesn’t scream at the reader. A web that informs.
			</p>

			<h3>Why is typography important</h3>

			<p>
				Jan Tschichold and Robert Bringhurst may not agree on how to define
				typography, but they certainly agreed on what its goal is. They just
				used different words to describe it. “The essence of new typography is
				clarity” is set in bold in Jan Tschichold’s book. “The new typography is
				distinguished from the old by the fact that its first objective is to
				develop its visible form out of the functions of the text… form must be
				created out of function” Tschichold elaborates.{" "}
			</p>

			<p>
				Bringhurst was more concrete. Typography must invite the reader into
				text, reveal the tenor and meaning of the text, clarify its structure
				and order and link the text with other existing elements.

				<p>
					Typography is more than that, it’s expressing language through type.
					Placement, composition, type choice.
