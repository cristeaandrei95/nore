		<h1>Life by Design: Practical Steps You Need to Take</h1>
		<h2>
			Most people never give themselves the opportunity to step back and see
			where they are in life.
		</h2>

		<p>
			In your life, there are going to be constant demands for your time and
			attention. How are you going to decide which of those demands gets
			resources? The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to
			whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the
			fastest reward. That’s a dangerous way to build a strategy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Life audit is a fundamental part of assessing how far you’ve come, where
			you want to go, what you should stop doing, and everything you should keep
			doing to become a better version of yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s a self-reflection exercise. An audit will leave you with the clarity
			and space you need to “do you” at the ultimate level.
		</p>

		<h3>When life is audited, performance improves</h3>

		<p>
			If you are future-focused, this is a helpful reminder to look back, even
			for a few minutes, and think about how far you’ve come and what you need
			to do to be better, and smarter in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping. It’s a better
			approach to redefine personal progress. Auditing yourself can help you
			sustain a ruthless level of prioritization and focus every week. It’s a
			practical way to achieve meaningful progress.
		</p>

		<h3>Your input predicts your output</h3>
		<p>
			Everything you allow into your life through all your senses — input — is
			processed as output that creates your results. If you expect a different
			output, start analysing your inputs. Measure your current inputs.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are not satisfied with your current output and your results,
			including your beliefs and your mindset, pay close attention to everything
			you spend time doing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most information is time-consuming, negative, and irrelevant to your goals
			and dreams.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don’t do the same thing over and over again, and expect different results.
			Deliberate lifestyle design is based on massive consistent
			action — output. Increased output necessitates decreased worthless input.
